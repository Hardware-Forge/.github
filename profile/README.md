## Crafting the revolution of semiconductors
### a Politecnico di Milano Research Group

At the hardware forge, we aim at advancing computing systems by designing innovative solutions for high-performance, reliability and security. Our expertises cover the areas of VLSI design, RISC-V processors, fault detection/tolerance and hardware security (transient execution attacks, fault attacks, hardware Trojan horses). We also collaborate with leading academic and industrial partners to bring cutting-edge solutions to the real-world.
